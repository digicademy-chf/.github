# CHF Community

This repository is reserved for community health files affecting the entire
Cutural Heritage Framework (CHF). These files are displayed for all other
repositories of this GitHub organisation as long as these repos do not contain
their own versions of the files. The code of conduct is a prime example of a
file that affects the entire community, and a [GitHub help page](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)
lists further options.
